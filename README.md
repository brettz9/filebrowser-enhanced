filebrowser-enhanced
====================

Overlays Firefox's built-in desktop browser with additional functionality.

Currently is limited to:

1. Placing the current directory as a native path within a textbox instead of as text.
1. Rather than needing to copy or change the file path within the browser's location bar, one may also copy-paste or change the native path within the page-internal textbox.
1. Adds a folder icon which can be clicked to reveal the current directory on the native OS desktop (e.g., open the currently browsed directory within Windows Explorer).

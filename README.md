filebrowser-enhanced
====================

Overlays Firefox's built-in desktop browser with additional functionality.

Currently is limited to:

1. Placing the current directory as a native path within a textbox (instead of showing the file: path as text).
1. Rather than needing to copy or change the file path within the browser's location bar, one may also copy-paste or change the native path within the page-internal textbox (which is capable of path autocomplete).
1. Adds a folder icon which can be clicked to reveal the current directory on the native OS desktop (e.g., open the currently browsed directory within Windows Explorer). A folder icon with the same functionality is also present on the add-on bar when browsing to a file: URL (e.g., when viewing a .txt file in Firefox), allowing one to jump to the containing folder on one's desktop.

Todos:

1. Incorporate [WebAppFind](https://github.com/brettz9/webappfind) functionality upon right-click.
1. Allow (power) sticky notes to be associated (as hidden files within the directory) to be displayed as an overlay when browsing files (as with a browser add-on and hopefully for a browser-in-browser)
